# HashMap

## Description
This project implements a basic HashMap data structure in JavaScript. It features methods for setting, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs, as well as for checking the presence of keys and dynamically resizing the internal storage when a specified load factor is exceeded. The implementation showcases how hash tables can provide efficient access to data through hashing and separate chaining for collision handling.
